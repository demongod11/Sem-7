"Critical Modernism" consists of four sets of ideas:  

- "holism", the idea that "society" is a unit in some sense and that it can be studied as a single 
entity; 
- "reflexivity", the idea that we can't simply observe society from the outside because we are 
also involved in it; 
- "rationality", the idea that we can understand society in ways which we can explain to other 
people; 
- and "social movements", the idea that creative human action both shapes the social whole 
and is shaped by it.
